      /*Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
      Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
      A primitive type always has a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
      A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.*/
